#+TITLE: Reset
Programming language firstly written using only GNU Assembly.
The main goal is to create programming language literally from scratch.
* Goals
- [X] Written in Assembly (see =asm= branch)
- [X] Bootstrapped
- [ ] Optimized
* Getting started
If you'd like to play with Reset, you can compile it by yourself.

Firstly, you need to compile bootstrapped version, located in =bootstrap=
folder.
#+begin_src shell
as --32 -o reset.bootstrap.o <bootstrapped file>
ld -melf_i386 -o reset.bootstrap reset.bootstrap.o
#+end_src

Using generated binary you can compile *.rt files. To compile one, you can do:
#+begin_src shell
./reset.bootstrap <reset file>
#+end_src
This will generate =output.asm= file for you. Using instructions above you can
compile it, to run your binary. That's it. Have fun!
